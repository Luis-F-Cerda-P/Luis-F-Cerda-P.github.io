## Hi, my name is Luis ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a (mostly) self-taught full-stack web developer with a background in law (which I no longer practice â€” unless weâ€™re debating something).

### ðŸ’» My first contact with code came during the pandemic  
when I wrote a terrible Google Sheets formula that technically worked â€” and completely changed my life. What began as a way to help a small family ecommerce venture (which needed automation more than anything) quickly became a full-blown obsession with solving problems through code.  

These days, the business runs smoothly without much of my help. The problems we initially set out to solve went away after a lot of hard workâ€¦ but the love for the craft stuck.

### ðŸŽ“ I earned full scholarships into two competitive bootcamps
to formalize what I'd been teaching myself. The first, funded by the Chilean government, focused on Ruby on Rails and helped me solidify web fundamentals through hands-on projects and mentorship. Later, I received another scholarship â€” this time from MercadoLibre and Globant â€” to join an 18-month full-stack Java/Spring/React program.  

While both were valuable and helped shape my foundation, most of my learning came (and still comes) from tinkering on my own, waking up early, staying up late, and making things that inevitably breakâ€¦

â€¦ then fixing themâ€¦ then breaking them againâ€¦ then fixing them againâ€¦ 
<br>
â€¦ and so on ðŸš€

  As of July 2025 I'm finishing Harvard's CS50x course and working toward the official certificate â€” both to fill in computer science fundamentals and simply for the joy of learning how things work at a deeper level.

  <h3> ðŸŽ¯ Iâ€™m curious, detail-oriented, and passionate about sharing what I know</h3>

  <div style="padding: 0 5%;">
  Right now, Iâ€™m focused on building practical side projects â€” like small web apps, developer tools, and workflow automations â€” while looking for a full-time role where I can grow, contribute, and keep learning.

  <div style="padding: 0 8%;">
  I like solving real problems, explaining things clearly, and occasionally playing guitar or piano when the code starts staring back at me.
