<!-- **TLDR:** Full-stack experience reservation platform featuring a React frontend (with Material UI), a RESTful Spring Boot API, and a MySQL database.
{: .notice--warning} -->

<!-- ## Overview -->

**Xplora** is a feature-rich reservation platform originally developed as the final project of a 1,500+ hour full-stack bootcamp. Built by a team of nine developers using Agile methodology over four two-week sprints, the app enables users to discover, view, and reserve experiences through a modern, responsive interface.

This portfolio version has been professionally adapted and deployed to demonstrate technical proficiency, production readiness, and deployment best practices.
